 Dubai (/duːˈbaɪ/ doo-BY; Arabic: دبي‎, romanized: Dubayy [dʊˈbajj], Gulf Arabic pronunciation: [dəˈbaj]) is the most populous city in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the capital of the Emirate of Dubai.<br>
 Established in the 18th century as a small fishing village, the city grew rapidly in the early 21st century into a cosmopolitan metropolis with a focus on tourism and hospitality. Dubai is one of the world's most popular tourist destinations.<br>
 It has the second most five-star hotels in the world and the tallest building in the world, the Burj Khalifa.<br>
Located in the eastern part of the Arabian Peninsula on the coast of the Persian Gulf, Dubai aims to be the business hub of Western Asia.It is also a major global transport hub for passengers and cargo.<br>
Oil revenue helped accelerate the development of the city, which was already a major mercantile hub. A centre for regional and international trade since the early 20th century, Dubai's economy relies on revenues from trade, tourism, aviation, real estate, and financial services.<br>
Oil production contributed less than 1 percent of the emirate's GDP in 2018.<br>
According to government data, the population of Dubai is estimated at around 2,921,376 as of 2021.
